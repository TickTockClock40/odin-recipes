        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These zesty Italian seasoned pretzels are an addictive snack that is so easy to make, but hard to stop munching on.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 oz) bag of pretzels</li>
            <li>1 (.7 ounce) packet Italian dressing mix</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large ziplock bag, mix all of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Let pretzels sit in the bag for 15 minutes then shake the bag and lay the bag over on the other side. Let it sit for another 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat over to 250 degrees. After the pretzels have finished marinating, spread them on a large cookie sheet and bake for 30-45 minutes. Stir the pretzels half way through. They will be done when there is no more oil and the pretzels look dried. Let them cool before storing.</li>
