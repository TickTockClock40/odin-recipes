The Odin Project - Learning to make a website and use Github

This is a project that I am starting to create a simple HTML webpage
using some of the functions that have been learned so far. Some examples
that may be included in this webpage that we learned are:

- HTML boilerplate creations
- Headings
- Links
- Images
- Lists

In addition to creating the webpage, I will be honing in on my skills to
properly stage and commit the project to GitHub.
